# Median Filter Image Processing
This project demonstrates adding synthetic noise to an image and applying median filters to reduce the noise. It also overlays a name on the image for identification purposes.

## Features

✅ Adds random noise (grain) to the image

✅ Applies 3x3 and 5x5 median filtering for noise reduction

✅ Overlays text on the original image

✅ Saves and displays all resulting images for evaluation
