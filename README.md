# Median Filter Image Processing
This project demonstrates adding synthetic grainy noise to an image and applying median filters to reduce the noise to simulate noise removal
and image smoothing. It makes use of different size kernels for noise reduction

## Features

- **Adds random noise (grain) to the image**

- **Applies 3x3 and 5x5 median filtering for noise reduction**

- **Saves and displays all resulting images for evaluation**
